# About Me
I am a researcher at [Telemetry Sports](https://telemetrysports.com/), where I focus on advancing computer vision, machine learning, large language models, and other AI technologies tailored for both professional and amateur sports industries.

Previously, I contributed to cutting-edge projects at [General Motors R&D](https://www.gm.com/research) and [Zenseact](https://zenseact.com/) (formerly Zenuity, a joint venture between [Volvo Cars](https://www.volvocars.com/us/) and [Veoneer](https://www.veoneer.com/en)), specializing in the development of advanced technologies for autonomous driving.

My expertise lies in robotic perception, computer vision, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, with a strong passion for leveraging these tools to solve complex, real-world challenges.
